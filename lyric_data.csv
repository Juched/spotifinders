Be someone who talks.
Don't waste away behind that tiny screen

Than friend requests and likes.
Think of all the things we haven't seen. Well, you—
You'll never see them if you're focused on the superficial.
You need real friends, if you know what I mean.
(CHORUS)
Look at me.
Can you see
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.
Look at me.
Do you know
What I know?
That you belong. Put down the phone, and look at me.
Take—take the time to see.
See what others see.
Don't trade that plastic box for all your friends.
You can make friends you know are true,
Who love Jehovah too,"

While my teeth sink in those lips

Hey
Niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack

And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless
Screaming ""Fuck the law"", my life is lawless
That's what you call it
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic

I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it

So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too

And seen the realest n***a I ever met in my life (laugh)

I done smoked weed where they said I can't
Got rich when they said I can't
Got high and got on the plane
And brought all my n****s when they said I can't
Went shopping places they said I can't
Bought some s**t that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows
Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't
Went hard in places they said I can't
Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks
And it's first class so I'm private plane
Nudie jeans with my Get Up Mane!
Rollin' papers and Mary J
I made eleven mill and I'm still the same

X2
What's with all these n****s and they feelings, man?
All of this and I'm still the man
Thought of this when I was just a fan
But all this money wasn't in the plan
Now it's all about them Benjamins
Ballin' hard and you in the stands
All this money I'm a business man
Out of all these n****s I'm the realest man"

You don't care, you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep babe, and now I know
Sweet, sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom boom
