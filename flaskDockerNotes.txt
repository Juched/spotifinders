requirements.txt are the required libraries that docker will have to import

How to Read the Docker Compose File
2 services: web and redis.
The web service builds from the Dockerfile in the current directory…
Forwards the container’s exposed port (5000) to port 5000 on the host…
Mounts the project directory on the host to /code inside the container (allowing you to modify the code without having to rebuild the image)…
And links the web service to the Redis service.
The redis service uses the latest Redis image from Docker Hub.


run the docker compose application:    docker-compose up -directory
stopping it: docker-compose stop
